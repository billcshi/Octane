1. Reused Code:
	* No outside code is used in this Stage.
2. Complete:
	* Stage 7 is completed.
3. Diversion with normal routers:
	* Using routing table can only control the traffic diversion based dst_ip and port pair. In SDN, we can diversion the traffic in many different attribution.
	* A secondary router, sometime have very limited CPU resource. Using SDN can make the traffic diversion simplier in secondary router.
	* The total network is more manageable with primary router in SDN than the normal network.
